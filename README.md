## Installation

* download [latest release](https://github.com/csabapalfi/tray-ping/releases/latest)
* open .dmg and drag TrayPing.app to Applications.

## Why?

* This app helps by displaying actual network status at a glance
* I keep ending up using unreliable WiFi networks.
* Even if I'm connected ping times spike periodically.
* Or request starts timing out all without loosing actual WiFi connection.

## What's missing?

* any sort of configurability (host, ping interval)
* open menu on right click not just left click
* reduce app size
* retina tray icon, app icons
