# tray-ping

Simple OSX tray application displaying google.com ping times.

## Why?

* This app helps by displaying actual network status at a glance
* I keep ending up using unreliable WiFi networks.
* Even if I'm connected ping times spike periodically.
* Or request starts timing out all without loosing actual WiFi connection.
